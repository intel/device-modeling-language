# Test how side-effects are carried out in failing accesses.

# The semantics are not well documented; the main motivation of the
# test is to catch involuntary semantic changes.

# The way it currently works, the register dispatcher performs the
# memop sequentially one register at a time, starting from the lowest
# address. The operation is aborted on the first error, which
# potentially leaves some remaining register accesses undone. There
# are four sources of failures:
# - The address might be outside all registers
# - It might be overlapping in a bank with overlapping=false
# - It might be a partial register access in a bank with partial=false
# - The read_access or write_access method might throw an exception.
