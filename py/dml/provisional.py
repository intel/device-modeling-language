class explicit_param_decls(ProvisionalFeature):
    '''This feature extends the DML syntax for parameter definitions to
    distinguish between an intent to declare a new parameter, and an intent to
    override an existing parameter (including when providing a definition
    for an abstract parameter). This distinction allows DML to capture
    misspelled parameter overrides as compile errors.

    The following new forms are introduced to mark the intent of
    declaring a new parameter:

    * For typed parameters, `param NAME: TYPE = value;` is essentially a shorthand for

          param NAME: TYPE;
          param NAME = value;

      and similarly, `param NAME: TYPE default value;` is essentially a shorthand for

          param NAME: TYPE;
          param NAME default value;

    * For untyped parameters, `param NAME := value;` is essentially a shorthand for

          param NAME;
          param NAME = value;

      and similarly `param :default value;` is essentially a shorthand for

          param NAME;
          param NAME default value;

    If one of these forms is used for overriding an existing
    parameter, then DMLC will signal an error, because the declaration
    was not intended as an override. DMLC will also signal an error if
    a plain `param NAME = value;` or `param NAME default value;`
    declaration appears that does not override a pre-existing
    parameter.

    In some rare cases, you may need to declare a parameter without
    knowing if it's an override or a new parameter. In this case, one
    can accompany a `param NAME = value;` or `param NAME default
    value;` declaration with a `param NAME;` declaration in the same
    scope/rank. This marks that the parameter assignment may be either
    an override or a new parameter, and no error will be printed.

    Enabling the `explicit_param_decls` feature in a file only affects
    the parameter definitions specified in that file.

@feature
class simics_util_vect(ProvisionalFeature):
    '''<a id="simics_util_vect"/>
    This feature enables the `vect` type, based on the
    `VECT` macro from the Simics C API (`simics/util/vect.h`).

    This is a simple wrapping that behaves inconsistently in many
    ways, and we plan to eventually introduce a cleaner mechanism for
    vectors; the `simics_util_vect` is supported as an interim solution until we
    have that in place.

    The syntax is `BASETYPE vect`, e.g. `typedef int vect int_vect_t;`
    to define a type for vectors of the `int` type.

    Some caveats:

    * `vect` types typically need to be `typedef`:ed before they are
      used.  This is because `int vect` is blindly expanded into
      `VECT(int)` in C, which in turn expands into a `struct`
      definition, meaning that saying `VECT(int)` twice yields two
      incompatible types. This means, for instance, that `typeof` in
      DML doesn't work properly for `vect` types unless `typedef`:ed

    * Importing `"internal.dml"` exposes various C macros from
      `vect.h` to DML: `VINIT`, `VELEMSIZE`, `VRESIZE`,
      `VRESIZE_FREE`, `VADD`, `VREMOVE`, `VDELETE_ORDER`, `VINSERT`,
      `VSETLAST`, `VLEN`, `VVEC`, `VGROW`, `VSHRINK`, `VFREE`,
      `VTRUNCATE`, `VCLEAR`, and `VCOPY`.

    * DML natively supports indexing syntax, which is translated to
      `VGET` (or `VSET` for assignment). For instance:
      ```
      typedef int vect int_vect_t;
      method first_element(int_vect_t v) -> (int) {
          assert VLEN(v) > 0;
          return v[0];
      }
      ```

    Enabling the `simics_util_vect` feature in a file only affects
    the `vect` declarations in that file.

    When the `simics_util_vect` feature is disabled, usage of `vect` is an
    error unless the [`experimental_vect` compatibility
    feature](deprecations-auto.html#experimental_vect) is enabled.
