    non-throwing DML 1.4 method calls it, then DMLC will analyze
    whether the method call can actually cause an exception. If it
    can, this error is reported; if not, the call is permitted.

    For this error, a 1.2 method counts as throwing if it throws an
    exception, or calls a `throws` marked 1.4 method, or
    (recursively) if it invokes a method that counts as throwing. A
    call or throw statement inside a `try` block does not cause
    the method to count as throwing. The methods
    `attribute.set`, `bank.read_access` and
    `bank.write_access` count as throwing even if they don't
    throw.

    This error is normally reported while porting common DML 1.2 code
    to DML 1.4: most 1.2 methods are not meant to throw exceptions,
    and when converted to DML 1.4 this becomes a strict requirement
    unless the method is annotated with the `throws` keyword.
    The remedy for this error message is normally to insert a
    `try` block around some call along the throwing call chain,
    with a `catch` block that handles the exception
    gracefully. The `try` block should usually be as close as
    possible to the `throw` in the call chain.

            this.templates.u.m();
            // This is rejected because the implementation of 'm' provided by
            // 'v' is not shared.
            this.templates.v.m();
        }
    }
    ```

    As a result, resolving a conflict between a non-`shared` method
    implementation and a `shared` method implementation can typically only be
    done by having most parts of the overriding implementation be non-`shared`:
    ```
    template uv is (u, v) {
        method m() {
            // OK; 'this' is a compile-time reference to the object
            // instantiating the template rather than a value of template type.
            this.templates.u.m();
            this.templates.v.m();
        }
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, a new `shared` method with non-`shared` implementation can
    be declared to allow access to the specific non-`shared` implementation
    needed (at the cost of increasing the memory overhead needed for the
    template type):
    ```
    template uv is (u, v) {
        method m() {
            m_impl();
        }

        shared method m_impl_by_v();
        method m_impl_by_v() {
            this.templates.v.m();
        }

        shared method m_impl() {
            this.templates.u.m();
            // OK
            m_impl_by_v();
        }
    }

    as well.  The automatic converter will adjust the names and
    signatures of a number of methods. Invocations, including
    `default()`, are not updated and must be manually converted
    (compile errors). Some method arguments are removed by the
    converter; if these arguments are used, the implementation must be
    modified accordingly. In particular, the `memop` arg of
    various bank and register methods is no longer present. This has
    been replaced with an argument `void *aux`, which is
    normally NULL.  If some register in a bank needs a memop, then the
    `io_memory_access` method can be updated to pass down the
    memop in the `aux` argument (just call `default`
    with `memop` in the last arg). An explicit call to a bank
    method, e.g. a redirection of an access to a different bank,
    should normally be rewritten as a call to `read` or
    `write`, usually with NULL in the `aux`
    argument.

    Bank methods are converted as follows: `access` â
    `io_memory_access`; `read_access`,
    `read_access_memop` â `read`;
    `write_access`, `write_access_memop` â
    `write`

    Register methods are converted like so: `read_access`

    `write_register`

    Field methods are converted thusly: `read_access`

    `write_field`

    In `register` and `field` objects, the
    `set` and
    `write_register`/`write_field` methods will get
    an explicit type `uint64`.

    The read and write methods on `bank`, `register`,
    and `field` objects all take a new `uint64` argument
    denoting enabled bytes or bits, depending on the context, which
    may mask an access.

    In `connect` objects, `validate_port` is converted
    to `validate`; named ports are deprecated in Simics 6, but
    the port name is available in the `port` session variable.

    In `attribute` objects, the `set` method will get
