    [Messages](messages.html) section.

    `WLOGMIXUP` is suppressed by default below Simics API version 7 in order
    to avoid overwhelming users with warnings, as the faulty pattern that
    `WLOGMIXUP` reports is very prevalent within existing code. Addressing
    applications of the faulty pattern should be done before or as part of
    migration to Simics API version 7.

    Passing `--no-compat=suppress_WLOGMIXUP` to DMLC has almost the same effect
    as passing `--warn=WLOGMIXUP`; either will cause DMLC to report the warning
    even when the Simics API version in use is below 7. The only difference
    between these two options is that if `--no-compat=suppress_WLOGMIXUP` is
    used (and `--warn=WLOGMIXUP` is not), then `WLOGMIXUP` may still be
    explicitly suppressed via `--no-warn=WLOGMIXUP`. In contrast,

@feature
class dml12_int(CompatFeature):
    '''This compatibility feature affects many semantic details of
    integer arithmetic. When this feature is enabled, DMLC translates
    most integer operations directly into C, without compensating for
    DML-specifics, like the support for odd-sized
    <tt>uint<i>NN</i></tt> types; this can sometimes have unexpected
    consequences. The most immediate effect of disabling this feature
    is that DMLC will report errors on statements like `assert 0;` and
    `while (1) { ... }`, which need to change into `assert false;` and
    `while (true) { ... }`, respectively. Other effects include:

    * Integers of non-standard sizes are represented as a native C
      type, e.g. `uint5` is represented as `uint8`, allowing it to
      store numbers too large to fit in 5 bits. With modern DML
      semantics, arithmetic is done on 64-bit integers and bits are
      truncated if casting or storing in a smaller type.

      Old code sometimes relies on this feature by comparing variables
      of type `int1` to the value `1`. In DML 1.4, the only values of
      type `int1` are `0` and `-1`, so such code should be rewritten
      to use the `uint1` type. It can be a good idea to grep for
      `[^a-z_]int1[^0-9]` and review if `uint1` is a better choice.

    * Some operations have undefined behaviour in C, which is
      inherited by traditional DML 1.2. In modern DML this is
      well-defined, e.g., an unconditional critical error on negative
      shift or division by zero, and truncation on too large shift
      operands or signed shift overflow.

    * Comparison operators `<`, `<=`, `==`, `>=`, `>` inherit C
      semantics in traditional DML, whereas in modern DML they are
      compared as integers. This sometimes makes a difference when
      comparing signed and unsigned numbers; in particular, `-1 !=
      0xffffffffffffffff` consistently in modern DML, whereas with
      compatibility semantics, they are consiered different only if
      both are constant.

    The `dml12_int` feature only applies to DML 1.2 files; if a DML
    1.4 file is imported from a DML 1.2 file, then modern DML
    semantics is still used for operations in that file.
