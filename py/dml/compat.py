    `WLOGMIXUP` is suppressed by default below Simics API version 7 in order

    `WLOGMIXUP` reports is very prevalent within existing code. Addressing
    applications of the faulty pattern should be done before or as part of
    migration to Simics API version 7.

    Passing `--no-compat=suppress_WLOGMIXUP` to DMLC has almost the same effect
    as passing `--warn=WLOGMIXUP`; either will cause DMLC to report the warning

    macros, because in those scenarios DMLC can become wholly responsible for
    proper type checking.

    While migrating away from this feature, the most common type errors that
    its disablement introduces are due to discrepencies between pointer
    types. In particular, implicitly discarding `const`-qualification of a
    pointer's base type will never be tolerated, and `void` pointers are only
    considered equivalent with any other pointer type in the same contexts as
    C.

class dml12_int(CompatFeature):
    '''This compatibility feature affects many semantic details of
    integer arithmetic. When this feature is enabled, DMLC translates
    most integer operations directly into C, without compensating for
    DML-specifics, like the support for odd-sized
    <tt>uint<i>NN</i></tt> types; this can sometimes have unexpected
    consequences. The most immediate effect of disabling this feature
    is that DMLC will report errors on statements like `assert 0;` and
    `while (1) { ... }`, which need to change into `assert false;` and
    `while (true) { ... }`, respectively. Other effects include:

    * Integers of non-standard sizes are represented as a native C
      type, e.g. `uint5` is represented as `uint8`, allowing it to
      store numbers too large to fit in 5 bits. With modern DML
      semantics, arithmetic is done on 64-bit integers and bits are
      truncated if casting or storing in a smaller type.

      Old code sometimes relies on this feature by comparing variables
      of type `int1` to the value `1`. In DML 1.4, the only values of
      type `int1` are `0` and `-1`, so such code should be rewritten
      to use the `uint1` type. It can be a good idea to grep for
      `[^a-z_]int1[^0-9]` and review if `uint1` is a better choice.

    * Some operations have undefined behaviour in C, which is
      inherited by traditional DML 1.2. In modern DML this is
      well-defined, e.g., an unconditional critical error on negative
      shift or division by zero, and truncation on too large shift
      operands or signed shift overflow.

    * Comparison operators `<`, `<=`, `==`, `>=`, `>` inherit C
      semantics in traditional DML, whereas in modern DML they are
      compared as integers. This sometimes makes a difference when
      comparing signed and unsigned numbers; in particular, `-1 !=
      0xffffffffffffffff` consistently in modern DML, whereas with
      compatibility semantics, they are consiered different only if
      both are constant.

    The `dml12_int` feature only applies to DML 1.2 files; if a DML
    1.4 file is imported from a DML 1.2 file, then modern DML
    semantics is still used for operations in that file.
