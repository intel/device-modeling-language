    DML 1.4. When this feature is enabled, DML 1.2 will permit the following:

    * `sizeof(typename)` (see `WSIZEOFTYPE`)

    * the `typeof` operator on an expression that isn't an lvalue

    * the `goto` statement

    * `select` statements over `vect` types

    * Passing a string literal in a (non-`const`) `char *` method argument

    * Using the character `-` in the `c_name` parameter of `interface` objects

    * Using the `c_name` parameter to override interface type in
      `implement` objects

    * `loggroup` identifiers are accessible under the same name in
      generated C code

    * Applying the `&` operator on something that isn't an lvalue
      (typically gives broken C code)

    * `extern` statements that do not specify a type (`extern foo;`)

    * Anonymous banks (`bank { ... }`)

    * Unused templates may instantiate non-existing templates

    * The same symbol may be used both for a top-level object (`$`
      scope) and a top-level symbol (non-`$` scope, e.g. `extern`,
      `constant` or `loggroup`)
