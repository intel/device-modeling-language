    objects.  When this feature is enabled, old-style interface ports
    are created as proxies to the interfaces on the respective port
    objects. Such proxies are not created for all banks and ports;
    e.g., banks inside groups were not allowed in Simics 5, so such
    banks do not need proxies for backward compatibility.

    attributes are only created When this deprecation is not enabled.
