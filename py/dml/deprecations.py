    registered by the `SIM_register_port_interface` API function) for
    exposing the interfaces of ports and banks. In newer versions of
    Simics, interfaces are instead exposed on separate configuration
    objects.  When this feature is enabled, old-style interface ports
    are created as proxies to the interfaces on the respective port
    objects. Such proxies are not created for all banks and ports;
    e.g., banks inside groups were not allowed in Simics 5, so such
    banks do not need proxies for backward compatibility.
