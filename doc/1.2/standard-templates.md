# Standard Templates

This chapter describes the standard templates included the DML
library. The templates can be used for both registers and fields. The
templates can be accessed after importing `utility.dml`.

The most common device register functionality is included in the
standard templates.

Note that many standard templates has the same functionality and only
differ by name or log-messages printed when writing or reading
them. The name of the template help developers to get a quick overview
of the device functionality. An example are the *undocumented*
and *reserved* templates. Both have the same
functionality. However, the *undocumented* template hints that
something in the device documentation is unclear or missing, and the
*reserved* template that the register or field should not be used
by software.

The sub-sections use *object* as a combined name for registers
and fields. The sub-sections refers to software and hardware reads and
writes. Software reads and writes are defined as accesses using the
`io_memory` interface (write/reads to memory/io mapped
device). Software reads and writes use the DML built-in read and write
methods. Hardware read writes are defined as accesses using Simics
configuration attributes, using the DML built-in set and get
methods. Device code can still modify a register or device even if
hardware modification is prohibited.

## \_read\_unimplemented

<section>

### Description

The object functionality associated to a read access is unimplemented. Write
access is using default implementation and can be overridden (for instance
by the read\_only template).

### Log Output

First software read to a register results in an unimplemented log-message on
log-level 1, remaining reads on log-level 2. Software reads to fields does
not result in a log-message.

### Parameters

log\_level\_high: sets the high log-level (default is 1, see LOG-OUTPUT)

log\_level\_low: sets the low log-level (default is 2, see LOG-OUTPUT)

### Related Templates

unimplemented, \_write\_unimplemented, silent\_unimplemented, design\_limitation

</section>

## \_write\_unimplemented

<section>

### Description

The object functionality associated to a write access is unimplemented. Read
access is using default implementation and can be overridden (for instance
by the write\_only template).

### Log Output

First software write to registers results in an unimplemented log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.  First write to a field (if
field value is not equal to write value) results in an unimplemented
log-message on log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.

### Parameters

log\_level\_high: sets the high log-level (default is 1, see LOG-OUTPUT)

log\_level\_low: sets the low log-level (default is 2, see LOG-OUTPUT)

### Related Templates

unimplemented, \_read\_unimplemented, silent\_unimplemented, design\_limitation

</section>

## checkreserved

<section>

### Description

Check if the value written to a register matches the bits in the
`reserved` parameter, and log a spec_violation when it does.

### Log Output

A spec\_violation message.

</section>

## clear\_on\_read

<section>

### Description

Software reads return the object value. The object value is then reset to 0
as a side-effect of the read.

### Log Output

None.

</section>

## constant

<section>

### Description

The object value will remain constant.
Software and hardware writes does not update the object value.
If this template is used on a register, it will not be checkpointed.

### Log Output

First software write to register or field (if field value is not
equal to write value) results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.

### Parameters

value: the constant value

init\_val: can be set instead of `value`, for forward
compatibility with DML 1.4

hard_reset_value: if `value` is `undefined`, this
parameter is used instead

### Related Templates

read\_constant, silent\_constant

</section>

## design\_limitation

<section>

### Description

The object's functionality is not in the model's scope and has been
left unimplemented as a design decision. Software and hardware
writes and reads are implemented as default writes and reads.
Debug registers are a prime example of when to use this
template. This is different from *unimplemented* which is
intended to be implement (if required) but is a limitation in
the current model.

### Related Templates

unimplemented, silent\_unimplemented

</section>

## ignore

<section>

### Description

The objects functionality is unimportant for both hardware and software.
Software and hardware reads return 0. Software and hardware writes
are ignored.

### Log Output

None.

</section>

## ignore\_write

<section>

### Description

Software writes are ignored. This template might also be useful for read-only
fields inside an otherwise writable register. See the documentation for the
read\_only template for more information.

### Log Output

None.

</section>

## no\_reset

<section>

### Description

The register's or field's value will not be changed on a hard or soft reset.

</section>

## noalloc

<section>

### Description

Do not allocate any storage for the object value, i.e.
sets the object's *allocate* parameter to `false`.

### Log Output

None.

</section>

## ones

<section>

### Description

The object is constant all 1's.
Software and hardware writes does not update the object value. The
object value is all 1's.

### Log Output

First software write to register or field (if field value is not
equal to write value) results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.

</section>

## read\_constant

<section>

### Description

Software reads return a constant value. No storage is
allocated for the object value.  If this template is used on a register,
it will not be checkpointed.

### Log Output

None.

### Parameters

value: the constant value

read\_val: can be set instead of `value`, for forward
compatibility with DML 1.4

hard_reset_value: if `value` is `undefined`, this
parameter is used instead

### Related Templates

constant, silent\_constant

</section>

## read\_only

<section>

### Description

The object value is read-only for software, the object value can be
modified by hardware.

### Log Output

First software write results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2. Fields will only log if the
written value is different from the old value.

If the register containing the read-only field also contains writable fields,
it may be better to use the ignore\_write template instead, since software
often do not care about what gets written to a read-only field, causing
unnecessary logging.

</section>

## read\_write

<section>

### Description

default read and write methods.

log-level 2. No logs on subsequent writes.
